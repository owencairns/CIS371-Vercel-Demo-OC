          <h2>REPORT</h2>
          <p>For section 1, I simply added an img element and set the src to the picture of me.
            Then, I set the height property to 100px to match the box. For section 2, I created
            an H1 element with my name, and an H2 element which contained my fake phone Number
            and also a phone icon (img). Next, for section 4 I was able to implement a table with
            headers and also a few of my classes. Using the :hover css attribute I made it so that
            the color of the row would change when you hover over it. Next, for section 5, I simply
            added an img element with a picture of Madrid, Spain as it corresponds to my Spain in Europe course.
            For section 6, I just added 3 anchor(a) elements which take the user to the website of each
            of the abbreviated names (Apple, Facebook, Google). For section 7, my paragraph was the 
            instructions to the FitnessGram™ Pacer test. I was able to put the 'b' 'i' and 'code' tags
            right inside the 'p' element. Finally, for section 8 I created 5 'a' tags, and inside I put
            5 logos as img elements and added the href corresponding to their websites as href attributes.

            more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter
            pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. <i>Line up
